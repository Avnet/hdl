Avnet HDL libraries, project build scripts, and example software source code used in Avnet Reference Designs/Tutorials.


###Current Tools Version:
- **Xilinx Vivado Design Suite**: [Vivado 2015.2.1]


###Where can I find documentation? 

This repository is intended to provide publicly accessible, revision controlled source code for Avnet Reference Designs/Tutorials.

The best way to find what you are looking for would be to start with the documentation for the Reference Design/Tutorial you are interested in.  If you cannot find a document that covers the piece of code you are interested in, then it is likely that code is no longer supported.

For a list of Reference Designs/Tutorials for your Avnet board, please visit the corresponding product page for your board and then click on the **Support Files & Downloads** OR **Reference Design/Tutorials** link.


###Where can I get support?

###I am an engineer, I found a bug and I want to contribute the fix back into this repo, how can I submit code changes?

- First of all, thank you for contributing!

- Please contact the support forum for the Avnet board you are using.


###I am an engineer at Avnet, how can I submit code changes?

- Code changes to the HDL repository must be pushed from the internal code repo, do not push changes directly to the Github **hdl** repo. 

- Please contact the Avnet Design Group for further details.

- If you are adding new code that you wrote, be sure to append the appropriate disclaimer headers (from the [legal] repo) to the top of your source files.
