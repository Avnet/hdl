Avnet HDL Reference Designs
===========================

Avnet HDL libraries, project build scripts, and example software source code used in Avnet Reference Designs/Tutorials.


Current Tools Version:
----------------------

* **Xilinx Vivado Design Suite**: [Vivado 2017.2]


Where can I find documentation? 
-------------------------------

This repository is intended to provide publicly accessible, revision controlled source code for Avnet Reference Designs/Tutorials.

The best way to find what you are looking for would be to start with the documentation for the Reference Design/Tutorial you are interested in.  If you cannot find a document that covers the piece of code you are interested in, then it is likely that code is no longer supported.

For a list of Reference Designs/Tutorials for your Avnet board, please visit the corresponding product page for your board on our community site and then click on the **Support Files & Downloads** OR **Reference Design/Tutorials** link.

Also, there is a much more detailed Application Note (more details than are needed to get started) which explains our methodology and how the Vivado build automation plus Avnet build scripting infrastructure can be useful for your own in house development team.
